<p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or BJJ is a martial art based on grappling and ground fighting, 
  focusing on the skill of controlling one’s opponent through techniques that force him or 
  her to submit. It prides itself in being known as the “gentle art”, allowing a smaller, 
  weaker person to use leverage and submissions (chokes, locks) to defend himself against a
  bigger opponent. With origins in Judo (Newaza) and Japanese Jujutsu, it has since been adapted 
  and modified by Carlos Gracie and his family to become the martial art it is today.</p>
